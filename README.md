# FreshTN
Find out what's in season in TN today! FreshTN is a mobile-friendly site that lets the user know all the TN produce that is currently in season.

## Usage
Use your favorite "server-in-a-box" to run. The Node [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) package or `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` are two great choices.

## TODO
This is still a work in progress. It needs, or could have added

- [ ] A caching strategy using Service Workers so that the page loads quickly on subsequent visits
- [ ] A minimal [app shell](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/your-first-progressive-web-app/step-01?hl=en) pre-rendered so something is immediately on the page when people visit
- [ ] Make the app shell reflect the season (light blue for Winter, burnt orange for Fall, etc.)
